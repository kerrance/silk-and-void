# Typography Showcase

Explore different typography configurations and see how Tailwind Typography adapts to various content types and styling preferences.

## Small Typography (prose-sm)

This is perfect for sidebars, captions, or any content where space is at a premium. The smaller typography maintains readability while conserving screen real estate.

- Smaller line height for tighter spacing
- Reduced font sizes throughout
- Ideal for supplementary content

## Base Typography (prose-base)

This represents the default typography scale that works well for most content types. It provides a balanced reading experience without being too large or too small.

> "The base typography scale is the Swiss Army knife of text stylingâ€”versatile, reliable, and suitable for most situations."

## Large Typography (prose-lg)

Large typography improves readability for longer content and creates a more immersive reading experience. This is particularly effective for articles, blog posts, and documentation where users will be reading for extended periods.

```javascript
// Example of code in large typography
function createReadableContent() {
  return {
    fontSize: 'large',
    lineHeight: 'generous',
    readability: 'excellent'
  };
}
```

## Extra Large Typography (prose-xl)

Extra large typography makes a statement. Use this for landing pages, feature articles, or any content where you want to create maximum visual impact and ensure excellent readability across all devices.

| Size | Best For |
|------|----------|
| XL | Landing pages, hero content |
| Large | Articles, long-form content |
| Base | General purpose content |
