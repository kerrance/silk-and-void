# Getting Started with Markdown

Welcome to your new Markdown-powered website! This guide will show you how to create and edit content using simple Markdown files.

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world's most popular markup languages.

### Why Use Markdown?

- **Simple to learn**: You can learn the basics in minutes
- **Portable**: Files are just plain text and work everywhere
- **Platform independent**: Works on any device running any operating system
- **Future proof**: Even if the application stops working, you can still read your files

## Basic Syntax

Here are some basic Markdown elements you can use:

### Headings

Use `#` for headings. More `#` symbols = smaller headings.

### Text Formatting

- **Bold text** with `**bold text**`
- *Italic text* with `*italic text*`
- `Inline code` with backticks

### Lists

Unordered lists use `-` or `*`:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

Ordered lists use numbers:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Links and Images

- [Link text](https://example.com)
- Images: `![Alt text](image-url.jpg)`

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, Markdown!");
}
```

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. Use `>` at the beginning of the line.

### Tables

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 | Row 1, Col 3 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 | Row 2, Col 3 |

## Creating New Content

To add new content to your site:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `content` directory
2. Add frontmatter at the top with title, description, date, and author
3. Write your content using Markdown syntax
4. The file will automatically be available on your site

## File Structure

```
content/
├── home.md          # Homepage content
├── typography.md    # Typography showcase
└── getting-started.md # This guide
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics, you can:

- Edit existing Markdown files to update content
- Create new files for additional pages
- Customize the styling in your Tailwind configuration
- Add more advanced Markdown features

Happy writing! ✨
